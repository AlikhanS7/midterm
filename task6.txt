1.In Git, switch is used to change branches, while checkout can do that and also restore files or commits. switch is more specific and user-friendly for branch management.
2.git merge combines changes from one branch into another, creating a new commit that incorporates both sets of changes.
3.After a rebase, the commit history is rewritten to create a linear sequence of commits. This avoids merge commits and makes the history cleaner, but it can alter commit hashes.
4.In the terminal, local branches are listed simply as their names (e.g., main), while remote branches are prefixed with the remote name (e.g., origin/main). You can see both with git branch -a.
